## 📞 In-Person Handoff Script

```
"Hey [Tech Lead],

I've got Epic-013 ready for your team. It's Gemini 3 Flash compliance -
taking us from 85% to 95%+ in about 1.5-2 weeks.

Good news: Epic-011 just completed, so there are zero blockers. All the
API migration work is done and tested (75/75 tests passing).

I've got 4 stories for you - test coverage, error logging, caching, and
analytics. Each story has a complete file with acceptance criteria,
technical details, and code locations. Everything's documented.

There are two handoff docs in docs/epics/:
1. EPIC-013-TECH-LEAD-BRIEF.md - quick overview
2. EPIC-013-DEVELOPER-HANDOFF.md - complete context

The story files are in docs/stories/ - Story-013-01, 013-04, 013-05,
and 013-06. About 900-1000 lines each with everything the devs need.

Two developers working in parallel can knock this out in 6-8 days.
Stories 013-01 and 013-04 can start immediately and run parallel.

Any questions before you kick off?"

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### Why This Epic Matters:
1. **Completes Gemini 3.x trilogy** (Flash + Pro High + Pro Low)
2. **Unique MEDIUM level** (Flash exclusive, not on Pro)
3. **Cost-effective reasoning** for budget-conscious workloads
4. **Foundation for Q2 optimization** (Epic-010 P2 stories deferred)

### Why Now:
1. **Epic-011 unblocked us** (API migration complete)
2. **Zero dependencies** - ready to start immediately
3. **Fast timeline** - 1.5-2 weeks to production
4. **High confidence** (85/100 readiness score)

### What's Different from Original Plan:
1. **Deleted 2 redundant stories** (013-02, 013-03 already implemented)
2. **30-40% faster** (2-3 weeks → 1.5-2 weeks)
3. **Cost savings** ($4K-$6K in dev time)
4. **Still achieves 95%+ compliance**
