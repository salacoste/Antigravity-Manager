## 🔧 Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Direct Codebase Search
```bash
# Search for specific model IDs in source code
grep -r "314\|315\|316\|317\|318\|319\|320\|321\|322\|323\|324\|325\|326\|327" src-tauri/
grep -r "314\|315\|316\|317\|318\|319\|320\|321\|322\|323\|324\|325\|326\|327" src/
```

### Strategy 2: Model Mapping Analysis
```
Files to examine:
- src-tauri/src/proxy/mappers/gemini/model_mapping.rs
- src-tauri/src/proxy/mappers/openai/model_mapping.rs
- src-tauri/src/proxy/mappers/claude/model_mapping.rs
- src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs
```

### Strategy 3: Configuration Search
```
Files to check:
- Configuration files in data_dir/config.json
- JSON account files in data_dir/accounts/
- Environment-specific configurations
```

### Strategy 4: Log Analysis
```
Search locations:
- data_dir/logs/ for rotating log files
- Application console output during proxy operations
- Error messages and debug traces
```

## 🎓 Format Examples

## 📝 Notes for Researchers

### Important Reminders
1. **Confidence Levels Matter**: Don't mark as "Confirmed" without strong evidence
2. **Document Everything**: Even "Not Found" is valuable evidence
3. **Reference Context**: Always include line numbers and file paths
4. **Log Analysis**: Check logs for actual usage patterns
5. **Cross-Reference**: Compare findings across code and documentation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Assuming a model ID maps to a specific model name without verification
- ❌ Missing variant models (e.g., -thinking, -exp, -image versions)
- ❌ Forgetting to check all three mappers (gemini, openai, claude)
- ❌ Overlooking feature flags or conditional compilation
- ❌ Not documenting the search strategy used

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Each model has a clear status (Identified, Unknown, or Deprecated)
- ✅ Code references include file paths and line numbers
- ✅ Confidence levels are justified by evidence
- ✅ Notes explain key findings succinctly
- ✅ All 14 models have entries (even if "Unknown")

## 🚀 Next Steps After Matrix is Complete

1. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for naming conventions and model family groupings
2. **Prioritize Implementation**: Use confidence levels to prioritize COMPARISON file creation
3. **Create Implementation Stories**: For models ready for documentation
4. **Validate Findings**: Cross-reference with team members
5. **Update MASTER-MODELS-TABLE**: Integrate findings into main documentation
